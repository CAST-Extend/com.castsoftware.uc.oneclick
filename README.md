CAST OneClick

OneClick is a powerful automation tool for running a full due diligence assessment for multiple applications. Its range of capabilities includes locating the code, performing CAST MRI and Highlight Analyses, and generating a comprehensive Due Diligence Assessment Report.

# Installation

## OneClick Software Requirements

To take advantage of all oneClick has to offer access to AIP Console, Highlight and the CAST REST API. OneClick also requires the installation and locations to the AIP Console and Highlight automation toolset, available on the CAST Extend website.

## Environment

OneClick is designed to perform a due diligence assessment from beginning to end for one or more applications in a project. This includes:

1.  Code discovery
2.  Run CAST MRI Analysis
3.  Run CAST Highlight Analysis
4.  Generate Action Plan
5.  Generate Due Diligence Assessment Report

To work properly the tool will need access to CAST AIP Console, CAST Highlight Rest API, Highlight Agent, Highlight CLI, and CAST MRI Rest API. The tool expects the working folder structure to be:

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](media/6b19822d60bebff38eb6236cbc6b572a.png)

-   code is the base folder referred to in the --baseFolder parameter.
-   .oneclick is generated by the tool containing all of the project configuration files.
-   DELIVER holds all the delivered code organized by project and application. The tool is expecting one folder for each application, this name will be used to represent the application going forward.

## Installing the tool

1.  Download the OneClick extension from the CAST Extend website.
2.  Extract the contents of the nugget file into a folder using a zip extraction tool.
3.  Right-click on the **install.bat** file and select "Run as administrator".

1.  [Download Python \| Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if not already done).
    1.  The tool was tested using python version 3.10

2.  Place the OneClick zipped nugget file on your local machine (C Drive preferably).
3.  Create an empty base folder (name as desired) on your local machine.
    1.  This folder will hold all the automatically created files by OneClick.
4.  Expand the nugget file into a folder, using zip.
5.  Open a command prompt, hold down windows key and press r, then type cmd enter.
6.  Using command prompt go to the folder containing the expanded nugget file.Type: install \<base folder location\>
    1.  The base folder location will hold all files used and/or created by the OneClick tool.
    2.  For more on this see the Environment section below.

# Command Line Arguments

OneClick has two types of arguments, the first is used for both project and global configuration. Once the configuration is complete the second argument type is used to run the application analysis and generate the assessment report.

```
oneClick config -b <base location> [-p <project name>] 
		or
oneClick run -b <base location> -p <project name>
```

## Project Configuration Files

Configuration files are stored in the **\<base folder location\>/.oneclick** folder, created during installation. There are two types, global and project. The common configuration file, config.json, contains information common to all applications. When a new project is created the tool incorporates all global configuration items into the project specification configuration.

## Configuration Settings

### AIP Console

Oneclick has been tested using both 1.x and 2.x Enterprise version of AIP Console. The *AIP Console integration tools* is used to access the Console which can be downloaded:

-   [Console Enterprise Edition](https://extend.castsoftware.com/#/extension?id=com.castsoftware.aip.console&version=1.28.2-funcrel)
-   [AIP Console integration tools](https://extend.castsoftware.com/#/extension?id=com.castsoftware.uc.aip.console.tools&version=1.0.1)

Make sure the **integration tools** and **AIP Console** version matches. After both are installed update the common configuration file:

```
oneClick config -b <base location> [-p <project name>] --consoleURL=http:\\<server>\ --consoleKey=<console-key> --consoleCLI=<console-integration-tool-location> --enable-security-assessment <true> --blueprint <true>
```
